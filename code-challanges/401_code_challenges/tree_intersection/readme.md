#Tree Intersection

#### By: Tim Schoen
This challenge  is to take in to trees, and return the values that are in both of them.

## Approach  
*  My Approach to this was to traverse both trees lists.  
*  The list from tree one, its values placed into a Hash Table
*  Itterate over the list from tree two and check to see if the values are in the hash table
    * if found append value to the list, and return list when finished

### Efficiency
Big O Time = O(n)
Big O Size = O(n)
