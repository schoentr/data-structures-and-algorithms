# array_reverse
# Reverse an Array
This algorithm reverses a list

## Challenge
This algorithm takes in a list and  reverses the list.

## Approach & Efficiency
My approach was to traverse across the list in reverse, appending them to the new list. 
You only need to traverse across the  list once to get values from the old list while appending them to the new list
