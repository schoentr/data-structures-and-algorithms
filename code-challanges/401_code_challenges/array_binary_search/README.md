# Binary Search of  an Array
This algorithm searches an inputed array, for an inputed value.  If found return the index, if not return -1.

## Challenge
Write an algorithm using minimal time and space to effectivly search an array and test.

## Approach & Efficiency
My approach was to find the midpoint of the array. See if it was equal, if so return  index,  if not set the midpoint as the high or low end depending on the greater or less
