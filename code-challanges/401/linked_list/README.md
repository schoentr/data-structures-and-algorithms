# Linked Lists


## Challenge
 Problem Domain: To create a Liked list, be able to add values(nodes) to the list and be able to print the list

## Approach & Efficiency
 Using TDD(Test Driven Development) I created tests:
 1.  My first test test to see if the nodes and linked list were created
 2.  My second test was able to test to see if one node was added to the list
 3.  My third test was able to test mutiple list and to make sure the ._next attribute was added properly
 4.  My last test was able to travese across the entire list and print the values to make sure both order and values were matained
